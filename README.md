# Sol Hayama üèñ

[sol-hayama](https://sol-hayama.tomoima525.com) is the decentralized NFT trading platform built on top of Solana block-chain.

- Search NFTs from a user's account(supports metaplex data structure)
- A programmatically generated escrow agent will manage the transaction and all transactions can be seen in Solana explorer

This is the frontend portion of the service. A smart contract(aka Program) that coordinates transactions is in [escrow-program repo](https://github.com/tomoima525/escrow-program)

## Architecture in nutshell

![architecture](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6277118/137241270-4e88c0ac-31f0-4948-b310-5819e11680af.png)


## Setup

```
yarn install
```

## Prerequisite

**Associated Token Account**

- You need Associated Token Account for [Native Mint](https://spl.solana.com/token#wrapping-sol) to receive the fee

```
// Make sure the owner has enough funding
$ spl-token create-account  So11111111111111111111111111111111111111112
```

**ProgramId for Escrow**

- You also need to deploy the program on localhost's test-validator. See the instruction in the escrow-program-repo
- After you deployed the contract, you should update the programId defined in `escrowProgramPublicKey` which is located at [constants.ts](https://github.com/tomoima525/sol-hayama/blob/main/src/constants.ts)

```
export const escrowProgramPublicKey = new PublicKey(
  "7V3CWKtaLtYqx82Rm96ph8DutCP2LQpfkz8URpH3XAxT" // this should be your program Id
);
```

**Amplify**

- This app caches transaction data on DynamoDB for performance purposes. We use GraphQL(AppSync) from Amplify.

```
// use npm v14
$ npm install -g @aws-amplify/cli
$ amplify init
? Do you want to use an existing environment? Yes
? Choose the environment you would like to use: dev
```

## Running locally

- Create `.env.local` (env file for nextjs) file and add below

```
NEXT_PUBLIC_LOCAL_ADDRESS=http://localhost:8899 // if you don't add this then the app will look into NEXT_PUBLIC_BUILD_ENV
NEXT_PUBLIC_FEE_PERCENTAGE=0.04
NEXT_PUBLIC_FEE_RECEIVER=Ae1c6oswsczoM7YtUdFLUviXMSvKgZTsZ3sJaPTyuVah // Change this to your associated account token that receives fee.
NEXT_PUBLIC_BUILD_ENV=dev
```

- Then start the app

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```
